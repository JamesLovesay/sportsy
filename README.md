## Functions in the app

The app is a tool for sports fans to interact and find like-mided people to play with, when the may not otherwise have anyone to play their favourite sport with.

A user of the app can register as a new user and thereafter utilise the login screen. The user can explore a nationwide map of events and access a single event via the relevant pin. A user can filter through available events by sport. A user can also create a new event to be posted to the app. Once a user has done so, they can view the My Events page to see what events they are hosting and what events created by other people they are attending. Finally, a user is able to comment on the individual event page once they are signed up to attend. A user has a profile and is able to edit it if required.
